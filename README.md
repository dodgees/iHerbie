# iHerbie
iHerbie is a simple bot that pulls relevent tweets from several Twitter accounts and posts the most popular tweet to the Huskers subreddit using the PRAW to interact with Reddit API. iHerbie pulls recent tweets from local newspaper accounts focused on the Nebraska Cornhuskers. It selects the most popular tweet based on favorites and retweets. Once selected, the tweet text is cleaned and the link to the actual content is found. After a post is made to r/Huskers, an email is sent confirming a successful post and the tweet is stored in a sqlite database. If the tweet has already been posted, it is discarded and a failure email is sent.
